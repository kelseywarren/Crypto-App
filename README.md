# Crypto App
Main purpose of this project is to get experience with:
1) Setting up a backend server
2) Routing external API calls through the backend
3) Serving API data from backend to frontend

## Features
- List of top cryptocurrencies by marketcap 

## Technologies 
- JavaScript
- React
- Node.js
- Express.js
- HTML
- CSS
- CoinMarketCap API
  
## Note
In the CoinMarketCap API documentation it states it will throw a CORS error if 
requests are made from the client. This inspired the desire to figure out how to solve this issue by 
routing requests through the backend.
